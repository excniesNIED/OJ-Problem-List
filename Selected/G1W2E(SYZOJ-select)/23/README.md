Description

```
A magic year is defined that a year number is a palindrome. For example, Year 1881, 1991, and 2002 are magic years while 110, 122, and 1222 are not.

As we all know, YHZ born in 1997, he also missed the year 1991, which is also a magical year. It is unusual for a man who can experience 2 magical years for post-80s who lives until 2002 at least. Therefore, he wants to know, if the life of a man can be extended, how many magical years he can experience. For idealization of the design, you may consider the life of a man can up to million even billion years.
